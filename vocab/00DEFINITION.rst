Collocation:
    A collocation is a general term referring to words that usually or always go together. 
    A collocation can perform various functions in a sentence (i.e. act as different parts of speech). 
    Some examples are “bunch of flowers” or “commit a crime.”

    => 固定搭配

Phrase/Phrasal verb:
    A phrasal verb is usually a combination of a verb + a preposition which usually changes the meaning from 
    that of the original verb. For example, “put + up with” means to tolerate, while “put + up” means to return
    something to its original/proper position (especially when cleaning), 
    and “put + off” means to delay doing something until a later time.
